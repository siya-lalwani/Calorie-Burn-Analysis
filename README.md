# 🏋️‍♀️ Calorie Burn Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview  
This project explores fitness data to analyze how different workout types, gender, body metrics, and heart rate influence **calories burned**.  
Through data visualization and machine learning, the project identifies key patterns and features that most impact calorie expenditure.  
It also demonstrates both **regression** (predicting calories burned) and **classification** (categorizing workouts into “Burns Calories” bins).

---

## 🧠 Objectives  
- Understand relationships between workout parameters and calories burned.  
- Visualize calorie distribution, workout comparisons, and gender differences.  
- Create a correlation heatmap to find numeric dependencies.  
- Build:
  - A **Random Forest Regressor** for calorie prediction.  
  - A **Random Forest Classifier** for binary calorie burn categorization.  
- Identify **most important features** using feature importance analysis.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – data cleaning and manipulation  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – modeling and evaluation  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – data exploration and analysis

## 📈 Key Visualizations  
1. **Histogram** – Distribution of Calories Burned  
2. **Boxplot** – Calories Burned by Workout Type  
3. **Countplot** – Workout Frequency by Calorie Burn Category  
4. **Scatterplot** – Calories vs Average Heart Rate  
5. **Barplot** – Average Calories Burned per Workout Type  
6. **Gender-based Boxplot** – Calories per kg by Gender  
7. **Correlation Heatmap** – Relationships among numeric features  
8. **Feature Importance Plot** – Top factors affecting calorie burn

## 🧩 Machine Learning Models
- **Random Forest Regressor**  
  - Predicts total calories burned.  
  - Evaluated using R² and MAE scores.  
- **Random Forest Classifier**  
  - Predicts whether a workout session “Burns Calories” significantly.  
  - Evaluated using a classification report.

## 🚀 Results Summary  
- Regression model achieved **good accuracy** (R² around ~0.8–0.9, depending on dataset).  
- Classification model showed **balanced performance** across calorie burn categories.  
- Top predictors included **Average BPM**, **Duration**, and **Workout Type**.
